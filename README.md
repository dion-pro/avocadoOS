# AvocadoOS
AvocadoOS is an OS completely programmed in Batch and soon will be a fully functional OS!

# Multitasking
You might need to configure **ADVe** to quickly run multiple AvocadoOS instances (In batch edition only)

# AvocadoPackage and AvocadoProgram
- Different packages are available here and updated regularly, you can code your own.
- Packages are stored in the pakc directory and ran using the pakcrun command.
- You need to rename your program to have a .pak extension.
- Programs are packages which are untrusted or system applications which are ran outside of the main OS. Programs have the .avc extension and are compiled to .bat **ONLY** due to the limitations of the system files and programs which the system does not trust.
- Packages have the .pak extension and can be any executable file and ran using the Package Compiler
